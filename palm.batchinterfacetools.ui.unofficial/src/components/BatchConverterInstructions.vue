    1. Download and complete a copy of the template below. Template data is flattened out, so data for records such as headers will need to be repeated (a sample file is included as a demonstration). 
    <br />
    2. Upload the completed template to the <strong>Input File</strong> field.
    <br />
    3. Optionally fill out the <strong>Agency</strong> and <strong>Agency Business System</strong> fields. They can be used in the name of the returned file.
    <br />
    4. Select an <strong>Output Format</strong>. File will return a text file based on PALM Knowledge Center specifications. Text Contents will return just the contents of the file.
